# Programming and Scripting
Assessment Repository for ATU Programming and Scripting Module 2025

By Siobh√°n Maher


## Week 1

- Submit your GitHub Repository to the Examiner and include a python program that displays Hello World! when it is run.

## Week 2
Write a program called bank.py 

The program should:

- Prompt the user and read in two money amounts (in cent)
- Add the two amounts
- Print out the answer in a human readable format with a euro sign and decimal point between the euro and cent of the amount

## Week 3
Bank account numbers can stored as 10 character strings, for security reasons some applications only display the last 4 characters (with the other other characters replaced with Xs).

Write a python program called accounts.py 

The program should:

- Reads in a 10 character account number
- Output the account number with only the last 4 digits showing (and the first 6 digits replaced with Xs).

Extra:
Modify the program to deal with account numbers of any length (yes that is a vague requirement, comment your assumptions)

## Week 4
Write a program, called collatz.py

The program should:

- Ask the user to input any positive integer and 
- Outputs the successive values of the following calculation.
    At each step calculate the next value by taking the current value and, if it is even, divide it by two, but if it is odd, multiply it by three and add one.
- Have the program end if the current value is one.
